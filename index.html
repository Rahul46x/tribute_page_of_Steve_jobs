            <p class="things-discription">Steve Jobs (1955-2011) was an American entrepreneur, inventor, and co-founder
                of Apple Inc., one of the world's most valuable technology companies. He was known for his innovative
                vision, design aesthetics, and ability to anticipate and create new markets.

                Jobs co-founded Apple Inc. with Steve Wozniak in 1976 and helped to develop the company's early
                products, including the Apple II personal computer and the Macintosh. He was also instrumental in the
                development of other groundbreaking products, such as the iPod, iPhone, and iPad, which transformed the
                way people listen to music, communicate, and use technology.

                Throughout his career, Jobs was known for his passionate commitment to excellence and his insistence on
                creating products that were not only functional but also beautiful and user-friendly. His impact on the
                technology industry has been immense, and his legacy continues to influence the design and development
                of new products today.

                Despite his many successes, Jobs was also known for his controversial management style and for his
                intense personality. He passed away in 2011 at the age of 56, leaving behind a lasting legacy as one of
                the most influential figures in the history of the technology industry.</p>
